The voltage transfer characteristic and propagation delays of a CMOS inverter are analyzed. The CMOS inverter is then designed using a layout editor so position and dimension specific parameters can be accurately approximated. After analyzing the properties of an integrated circuit MOSFET in the layout editor, CMOS inverters of different dimensions are analyzed. The effects of transistor widths on propagation delays and voltage transfer characteristics are approximated.
