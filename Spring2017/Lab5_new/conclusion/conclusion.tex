\subsection{Voltage Transfer Curve}

\FloatBarrier

The voltage transfer curve of the common-source amplifier closely aligns with the results predicted by theory, namely the inverting properties of the amplifier and the clamping of the output near $V_{DD}$ and ground. The optimal bias point is chosen to be in the middle of the curve since this is where the output swing is maximized and high linearity is achieved. The threshold voltage is also acquired by observing where the transistor exits cutoff, evident from the point at which the voltage transfer curve begins to decrease.

\subsection{Common-Source Amplifier with Passive Load}

\FloatBarrier

Various small-signal properties of the common-source amplifier circuit are ascertained in the experiment. The measured gain differs from theoretical results, but lies within the same order of magnitude as the theoretical gain. Thus, the MOSFET and amplifier models used are somewhat reliable. Theoretical results have difficulty accounting for manufacturing and environmental variations in the components. Therefore, a truly reliable analysis is difficult to achieve.
