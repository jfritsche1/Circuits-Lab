The properties of various MOSFET amplifiers are analyzed. First, a common-source amplifier with a simple resistor is simulated. Its behavior when a small signal is applied and at various bias points is then considered. The resistor is then replaced with an NMOS transistor. After this, a CMOS amplifier and a common source amplifier with a complementary load are both simulated.
