For the common source amplifier with a passive load, the largest resistor value gives the amplifier the best linearity and performance. The amplifier should be biased in the saturation region for best results. As the bias voltage $V_{GS}$ is increased, $g_m$ and gain increase, and $r_o$ decreases. When an active load, namely an NMOS transistor, is used in place of a resistor, the performance is not as good. The CMOS amplifier offers better performance than using two NMOS transistors. When a complementary load is simulated, again, the largest resistor tends to lead to the highest quality amplifier.
