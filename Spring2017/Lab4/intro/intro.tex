Two MOSFET circuits are analyzed. First, a PMOS current mirror is considered. Bias simulations are run for different transistor widths to characterize the purpose of the current mirror and the effect that changing MOSFET widths has on the circuit's operation. Then, a common source amplifier with a PMOS current mirror is analyzed. It is properly biased before its gain is determined. Further simulations then characterize the voltage transfer characteristics and state space of operating points for the circuit.
