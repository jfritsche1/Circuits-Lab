A CMOS inverter and CMOS logic NAND gate is constructed to be used in the D Latch layout design.

The width and length of the NMOS to be used in the inverter is given to be $0.5$ \si{\nano\meter} and $0.1$ \si{\nano\meter}, respectively.
The PMOS to be used in the inverter is then designed so that the inverter is matched (steepest slope of the VTC curve occurs when $V_{out} = V_{in} = \frac{V_{DD}}{2}$).
The CMOS inverter is matched using a PMOS with a width $W = 1.2$ \si{\nano\meter} and a length $L = 0.1$ \si{\nano\meter}.
This results in the following layout for the CMOS inverter.

The VTC of the CMOS inverter shown below verifies that it is matched.

The logic of the CMOS inverter is verified using a $250$ \si{\mega\hertz} clock input with a rise and fall time of $0.050$ \si{\nano\second}.

Next, a CMOS logic NAND gate is constructed with two PMOS in parallel and two NMOS in series.
The NAND gate is designed so that it operates with the same speed of the CMOS inverter.
To achieve this design goal, the width of both NMOS are doubled to $W = 1.0$ \si{\nano\meter} so that it operates twice as fast to compensate for the speed lost due to having two NMOS connected in series.
This results in the following layout for the NAND gate.

The delays for the transitions between Q high and Q low ($\tau_{PHL}$) and vise versa ($\tau_{PLH}$) can be used to determine the maximum operating frequency of the D Latch.

The D Latch is tested with input clock C at $250$ \si{\mega\hertz}, $1$ \si{\giga\hertz}, and $4$ \si{\giga\hertz} with clock D always set to half the frequency of C.
Rise and fall times of $0.050$ \si{\nano\second} and $0.001$ \si{\nano\second} are tested for each clock frequency.

It is observed that the delay of the D Latch is only dependent on the rise and fall times of the input clocks.
This behavior is expected because the dynamic portions of the inputs are kept constant and the length of the static portions of the input should not affect the performance of the circuit as long as they are longer than the delays.

The most ideal rise and fall times of the input clocks, $0.001$ \si{\nano\second}, result in the output delays $\tau_{PHL} = 23$ \si{\pico\second} and $\tau_{PLH} = 15$ \si{\pico\second}.
Taking the longer delay $23$ \si{\pico\second}, the maximum operating frequency of the D Latch is determined to be $1/23$ \si{\pico\second} $= 43$ \si{\giga\hertz}.

The length of the D Latch layout is $12.650$ \si{\micro\meter} and the width of the layout is $5.850$ \si{\micro\meter}. The total area of the layout is $74 \mu m^2$.

Operating at $1$ \si{\giga\hertz}, the average power consumption is determined to be $14.240$ \si{\micro\watt}.
