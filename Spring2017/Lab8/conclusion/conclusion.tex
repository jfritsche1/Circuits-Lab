The final D-latch design outperforms all aspects of the specification by a decent amount.
However, the design can be made even better.
The area can decreased substantially by consolidating many of the PMOS and NMOS transistors.
For instance, the PMOSs in each NAND gate can be implemented using one p-diffusion region and two gates, sharing the same drain terminal, saving area on the chip.
Furthermore, speed and area can be saved by using only inverters and transmission gates in the design.
Signals would need to travel through fewer transistors, increasing speed and decreasing area.
