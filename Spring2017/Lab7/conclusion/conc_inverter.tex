The highest quality voltage transfer characteristic occurs when a sine wave input is applied. It may have to do with the relatively higher density of points in a sine wave since the sine wave is longer than the ramp in one period if unrolled. The noise margins are similar to what is often received in simulation results for well-designed CMOS inverters.
