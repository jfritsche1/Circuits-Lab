The SPICE simulation and the logic chart for the two-input NAND gate effectively show the true behavior of the circuit constructed on the bread board.
However, the true behavior of the circuit would also show propagation delay between the input and output waveforms.
But propagation delay may be negligible because the circuit is tested using low-frequency $1 -2$ \si{\kilo\hertz} square waves as inputs.
