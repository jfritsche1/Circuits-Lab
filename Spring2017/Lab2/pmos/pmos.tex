\subsubsection{Part A}
Using the circuit shown in figure (\ref{fig:pmos_circuit}), $I_{sd}$ is measured as the drain voltage is varied from within the range of $0 V \le V_{sd} \le 5 V$. 
The value of the gate voltage is set to $V_{sg} = 2.5V$.

From the $I_{sd}$ vs $V_{sd}$ curve in figure (\ref{fig:pmos}), this PMOS transistor is not active until $V_{sd} \approx 1.8 V$. This region should not be called cutoff mode since cutoff mode implies that $V_{sg}$ is too low. The transistor simply does not operate below the determined $V_{sd}$, which is not consistent with theory.

To turn on this transistor the gate voltage must be greater than the source voltage by at least the absolute value of the threshold voltage. 
This means that at $V_{sd} = 1.8 V$, $V_{sg} \ge |V_{tp}|$.
\\

To operate in triode mode $V_{sd}$ must be less than $V_{sg}$ by at least the absolute value of the threshold voltage.
The transistor operates in the triode mode for $ V_{sd} \ge 1.8V$.
Given that the data does not show signs of entering saturation mode, it is not possible to find the saturation edge from the data alone.

\subsubsection{Part B}
Part B uses the same procedure as part A, but the gate voltage is changed to $V_{sg} = 5 V$.

\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier
Much like in part A, the transistor is strangely inactive until $V_{sd} = 3.05 V$. This behavior cannot be explained using this lab's currently accepted transistor models and theory.
It then operates in triode mode for the rest of the values tested up to $V_{sd}=6V$.
Given that the data does not show signs of entering saturation mode, the saturation edge cannot be determined without further analysis.
