The $i_D$ versus $V_{ds}$ ($V_{sd}$ for PMOS) curves are determined for the NMOS and PMOS transistor at different values of $V_{gs}$ ($V_{sg}$ for PMOS). The NMOS transistor's behavior is then further examined by acquiring the voltage transfer characteristics of a common-source and common-drain amplifier. Properties of the amplifiers, such as operating regions at different $V_{in}$ values, are observed. A CD4007 MOSFET IC is used for the experiments.
