% NMOS
The resulting measurements from the NMOS transistor experiements agree well with theory, and the transistor moving through all the modes of operation can be observed. The data clearly shows the transistor's threshold voltage. The effect of the NMOS's capacitance when varying $V_{ds}$ can be observed. The accumulated charge in the channel is enough to keep the channel open widely enough so that the drain current is twice as large as when the accumulated charge is not present. 
  
% PMOS
The PMOS transistor clearly displays operation in triode mode. The transistor remains inactive for a range of $V_{sd}$ values. This range widens as $V_{sg}$ is increased. This behavior cannot be explained with the currently available transistor models and theory.
