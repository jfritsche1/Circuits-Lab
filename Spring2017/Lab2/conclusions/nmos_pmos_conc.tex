% NMOS
The resulting measurements from the NMOS transistor experiements agreed well with theory, and we were able to see how the transistor moved throught all the modes of operation. The data clearly showed the transistor's cutoff voltage and threshold voltage. We noticed the effect of the NMOS's capacitance when moving from triode mode to cutoff. The accumulated charge was enough to keep the channel open so that the drain current was twice as large as when the accumulated charge was not present. 
  
% PMOS
The PMOS transistor clearly displayed operation in cutoff and triode mode. We were able to observe a variable cutoff voltage, because the source voltage is not grounded. We noticed that we were able to change the cutoff voltage by varying the gate voltage.
