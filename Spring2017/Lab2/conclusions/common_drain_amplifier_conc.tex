The common drain amplifier essentially follows the trend of the input voltage at the gate, $V_{in}$. It starts in the cutoff region since the input voltage is too low to form the channel. However, as the input is increased, the current flows, and an output voltage develops over the resistor. It transitions from cutoff to saturation to triode, but does not reach triode in the range of voltages considered. The proper bias point occurs in the middle of the saturation region since the slope is steepest. Moreover, biasing the amplifier in the saturation region leads to high linearity in the output of the amplifier.
