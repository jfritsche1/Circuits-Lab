Oscilloscope impedance and voltage measurements can be more accurately ascertained at frequencies and for resistance values where R and the oscilloscope's impedance $Z_{scope}$ have comparable magnitudes. This can be done by using a small reference impedance R at a high frequency, so that the tiny capacitive impedance drops $|Z_{scope}|$ to a value close to R. However, the best results are obtained by using a large reference impedance R at a low frequency. This is why the 1M$\Omega$ at 1kHz yields astonishingly accurate results.
