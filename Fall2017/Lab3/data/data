Thickness - 280um +- 25um
F = 4.54 or so when d/S >> 20
Measure slope of best fit line through R_s
Show schematic of voltmeter and carriers. Explain n- and p-type measurements

Red probe at soldering iron
Black probe at other end of the wafer

Wafer 1
-------
0.25V
Polarity of flipped: 

Wafer 2
-------
Polarity flipped: 0.25V

Wafers are tiny. Gets uniformly heated

Wafer 1
-------
-0.3 -> -0.8V

reverse polarity check: 0.2 -> 0.9V

Wafer 2
------
0.4 -> 0.7V

reverse polarity check:

Placing red probe on wafer and letting iron heat up before placing black probe:

Wafer 1
-------
-6.5V and then dropping to -4V

Wafer 2
-------
Wafer is very small no good

Wafer 1
-------
Reverse polarity: approx. -0.8V

Wafer 1 again
-------------
-5.7V
-6V again
Flip polarity: 0.7 - 0.8 a few times

Replaced the probe with the same model for ground as supply
Wafer 1: -7V to -6.5V
Flip polarity:

4-point probe is n-type
V = 2.3mV
I = 0.0565mA
s = 1.25mm
d = 2cm
