\underline{Procedure}

The objective of this lab is to observe many different types of diodes using an oscilloscope and a curve tracer. A circuit is built with a voltage supply (DC) in series with a resistor, and the resistor in series with multiple diodes. Voltmeters are attached across the resistor and diode to measure the voltage drop over both of them. The source voltage is varied and so the many different measurements of the diode voltage and diode current are measured using the voltmeter. Next, the I-V characteristics of the diodes and the breakdown voltage are measured. Lastly, a phototransistor is used in the circuit, and it is illuminated with a flashlight in reverse, zero, and forward bias to make it function as a photodiode. The change in current is then observed. \\
