The objective of this lab is to measure and investigate the static input, static output, and static transfer of MOSFETs and BJTs. The first part of the experiment includes building a circuit with voltage supplies, resistors, and a NPN transistor. The voltage of the first source (V\textsubscript{1}) is varied and V\textsubscript{BE} and I\textsubscript{C} is to be measured and plotted. The second step is then to modify the circuit and to measure and plot, V\textsubscript{CE} and I\textsubscript{C} while changing the second voltage source (V\textsubscript{2}). The circuit is then changed by replacing the BJT transistor with a MOSFET. The voltage of the first source is again varied, but this time V\textsubscript{GS} and I\textsubscript{D} are measured and plotted while V\textsubscript{T} (threshold voltage) is only measured. Lastly the value of V\textsubscript{GS} is set to 5V, and the second voltage source (V\textsubscript{2}) is varied to measure and plot V\textsubscript{DS} and I\textsubscript{D}. \\
