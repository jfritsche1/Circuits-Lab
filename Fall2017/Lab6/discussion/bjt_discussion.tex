The $I_C - V_{BE}$ and $I_C - V_{CE}$ curves obtained from experimental measurements are very consistent with theoretically expected behavior for the NPN BJT. The cureves can potentially be smoothened by measuring more intermediate data points at the observed transitions between regions on the curve. This portion of the experiment quantifies the switching behavior of the NPN BJT and it is noted that it is very similar to that of the MOSFET despite fundamental differences in physical structure.
