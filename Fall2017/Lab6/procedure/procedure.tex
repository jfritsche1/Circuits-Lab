The objective of this lab is to determine the characteristics of bipolar-junction transistors (BJTs) and metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs). The first part of the experiment involves building a circuit with a BJT. The voltage of the first source (V\textsubscript{1}) is varied, and a plot of $I_C$ against $V_{BE}$ is ascertained. The second step is to vary $V_2$ and acquire a plot for $I_C$ versus $V_{CE}$. The circuit is then changed by replacing the BJT with a MOSFET. The voltage of the first source is again varied, but this time a plot for $I_D$ against $V_{GS}$ is determined. A plot for $I_D$ against $V_{DS}$ is then acquired. More details on the implementation and measurements are included in each transistor's respective section. \\
