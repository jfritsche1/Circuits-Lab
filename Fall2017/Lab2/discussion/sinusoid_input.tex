While the high-pass filter yielded a very good result, the low-pass filter produced a more non-ideal result. This is most likely due to the intervals of frequency in which the output voltage is measured. Measuring output voltage at even smaller intervals of frequency near the theoretical corner frequency would have definitely produced better results as the gain would be able to more closely reach the -3 dB gain in which cutoff frequency is measured. Of course, the discrepancies between theoretical and measured values may also be due to errors in resistance and capacitance of the system tested, as the tolerances of both the resistor and capacitor is approximately 5\%.
