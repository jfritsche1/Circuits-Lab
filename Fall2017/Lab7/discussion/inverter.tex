The BJT inverter circuit yields an expected output given a periodic square input signal. As expected, the $10$\si{\kilo\hertz} input signal is essentially inverted by the inverter with slight delay and ramping due to the recombination of excess carriers during the BJT's transition from saturation operation to cutoff operation and vice versa. The large delay times or slow switching behavior characteristic of the BJT makes the BJT inverter circuit unusable in high frequency RF applications.
