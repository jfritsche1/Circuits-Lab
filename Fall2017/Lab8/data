Resistor - 296 ohms
We need to measure fall time, rise time, delay at the front and back
yellow - input, green - output
y2 - y1 = 5.175 V, output pulse height
starts at y1 = -6.55V, and y2 = -1.375V
rise time = 24ns
fall time = 14.4 ns
peak of the input = 5.075V
rising edge of input to falling edge of output = 2.4ns
falling of edge of input to rising edge of output = 10.4ns
the settings for the square wave - 10kHz, 50% duty cycle, high is 5V while low is 0V

200mvpp. 2.5vdc offset
Clamps at 250 mvpp. Outside saturationa mode
3.3V is the peak to peak
input - 200mV, output - 3.3V, the gain is 16.5
3.6MHz is -3db upper cutoff. Gain is 16.5/sqrt(2) = 11.7
