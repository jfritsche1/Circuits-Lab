The objective of this lab is to build an inverter with MOSFETs (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors) and demonstrate its use as a switch and an amplifier. For the first circuit, the switching behavior of a MOSFET is observed. A circuit with multiple components is built and a voltage pulse is given to the transistor to observe the output voltage signal. The input pulse signal is increased so the time delay, rise time, and fall time are measured. Next, the amplification properties of the MOSFET are demonstrated. An input signal at 10kHz frequency is applied, and the input and output voltage signals are observed. The input voltage is increased until the output voltage starts to clamp. The gain is then measured. The upper cutoff frequency is measured along with voltage gain at this frequency. Lastly, the cutoff frequency is tested while observing the output after setting the function generator to square wave input. \\
