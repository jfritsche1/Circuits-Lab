The objective of this lab is to design a transistor inverter and observe both the switching and amplifier characteristics of MOSFETs. For the first circuit, the switching behavior of a MOSFET is observed. A circuit with multiple components is built and a voltage pulse is given to the transistor to observe the output voltage signal. The input pulse signal is increased so both the turn-on and turn-off transients are observed and the time delay, rise time, and fall time are measured. Next, the circuit for the MOSFET Amplifier is built. The bias voltage is measured without connecting the input source to the amplifier, which should be half of the DC power supply. After measuring, apply an input signal at 10kHz frequency to display both the input and output voltage signal (sinusoidal). The input voltage is increased until the output voltage starts to clamp. The gain is then measured. The upper cutoff frequency is measured along with voltage gain at the certain frequency. Lastly, the cutoff frequency is tested while observing the output after setting the function generator to square wave input. \\
